<!-- from Gemini on 12-May-2024
Create an SVG file with text "Doing Azure" where "Doing" is above "Azure". 
Make the text color the same as the blue/azure color from the Microsoft Azure logo.
Make the font for "Azure" bold and as similar to the "A" in the Microsoft Azure logo as you can. Make the font for "Doing" the same, except not bold.
For alignment, make sure the text is centered in the SVG file.

<Gemini's response was pretty good, though I still made some tweaks>
